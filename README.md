"Neural Networks are inspired by Human Brain,basically these are Sub-Representation of Human Brain"

What is Pytorch ?
PyTorch is an open source machine learning (ML) framework based on the Python programming language and the Torch library. Torch is an open source ML library used for creating deep neural networks and is written in the Lua scripting language. It's one of the preferred platforms for deep learning research. The framework is built to speed up the process between research prototyping and deployment.

What is a Neural Network ?
Neural networks, also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs), are a subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep learning algorithms. Their name and structure are inspired by the human brain, mimicking the way that biological neurons signal to one another.

#Basic Working of a Neural Network

∑wixi + bias = w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + bias

output = f(x) = 1 if ∑w1x1 + b>= 0; 0 if ∑w1x1 + b < 0
